# brOscatLib

![LOGO](logo.png)
This repo is a port of the popular [Oscat lib](http://www.oscat.de) to the B&R Automation studio platform. The library contains all functions and function blocks that are in OscatBasic 3.34, Oscat building 1.00 and the Oscat network 1.35.2 library. At the moment, the libraries are a work in progress, the main programmatic porting has been going well and some 1000 errors still remain before it can be compiled in Automation Studio. Depending on the ammount of contributers the library will be ported to completion. Initial port was done from Codesys plc open xml export.

## Documentation

Each POU has a link to its chapter in the related documentation. The documentation is available by clicking the link provided in the POUs declaration and at the top of the code implementation. For the automatic PDF navigation to work your browser must have Adobe Acrobat extension installed. Note: Some of the POUs do not navigate correctly as the Oscats official documentation hasn't updated the table of contents.

NOTE: At the moment I have no Automation Studio available as the funding for the project is non existant and Automation studio Evaluation license cannot be used for porting these libraries.
