    (* revision history
    hm 20. jan. 2007	rev 1.1
    	added INput N to specify the amOUT of samples for average and HIGH LOW calculations
    	added TRIG OUTput

    hm 10. sep. 2007 	rev 1.2
    	an error would be generated if N was set to 0, now n is forced to1 if set to 0.
    	INdex was OUT of array.

    hm	17. sep. 2007	rev 1.3
    	replaced time() with t_plc_ms() for compatibility reasons

    hm	6. jan. 2008	rev 1.4
    	improved performance

    hm	14. jun. 2008	rev 1.5
    	set default for INput N = 16

    hm	10. mar. 2009	rev 1.6
    	added type conversion for compatibility reasons
